# My_Porfolio

A little fun idea, of creating a portfolio website, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then dockerizing it as an image, and deploying it to a container, and perhaps developing it more in the future and deploying it whenever I need it. Adding automated CI/CD to it perhaps. It's just a fun little project.

## Description

This is a portfolio website that I created to showcase my projects and skills. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more projects and features to it as time goes.
