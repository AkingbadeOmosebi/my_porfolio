My Portfolio Project

This project started as a fun way to build a sleek portfolio website for me that highlights my projects and skills. I developed the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, customizing a template to fit my style perfectly.

Then, I took it further by containerizing the site with Docker, pushing the image to AWS ECR, and deploying it on AWS ECS. All the infrastructure is managed with Terraform, automated seamlessly through a Spacelift CI/CD pipeline.

What’s Inside?

- Fully customized front-end crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Dockerized container running on Nginx

- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform

- Automated deployment via Spacelift pipeline

Getting Started

I didn’t want to waste time trying to design the best looking version from scratch, so with my catchy eyes I started with a base template, then applied my front-end web dev skills to make it uniquely mine, focusing on clean, responsive design and smooth user experience, then i went the extra mile of taking a portrait photoshoot of myself by myself and adding it for fun. Then eventually showcasing my Cloud DevOps skills through Infra, Containerization, CI/CD, etc.

In the coming future, I will perhaps add more fun little features and styles to the app...
