# My_Porfolio

A little fun idea, of creating a portfolio website, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then dockerizing it as an image, and deploying it to a container, and perhaps developing it more in the future and deploying it whenever I need it. Adding automated CI/CD to it perhaps. It's just a fun little project.

## Description

This is a portfolio website that I created to showcase my projects and skills. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more projects and features to it as time goes.

## Getting Started

Did not want to waste too much of my time, designing and developing a website from scratch, so I used a base template from the internet, and being very skilled with web development and web design, i easily inspected my key places, modified and customized it to my liking.

### Dependencies

HTML > CSS > JS > DOCKER > NGINX (Basic Dev Tools)
